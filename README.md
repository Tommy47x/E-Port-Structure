Welcome to E-Port! First step for a safer internet. My name's Tommy and I'm a Junior Developer, I made this app because I wanted to help people learn more about the internet and it's vulnerabilities. Our app uses the nMap program throught node-nmap to scan the internal / external IP adress for open ports. Now, an open port doesn't necessary mean It's a vulnerabiliy. A port could be intentionally left opened as a honeypot so the company can undo attacks immediately and report them to the authorities.

!! I do not recommend scanning unknown networks, It's illegal in many states, can be considered as a cyber-security crime if you don't know what you're doing.
